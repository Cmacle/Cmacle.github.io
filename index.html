        <div class="AboutMe">
            <p>Hi, I'm Conor. I've worked in the Audio-Visual field for a few years
            before moving on to chase my passion in programming. I have experience working or leading
            teams of people to accomplish large tasks and run events. I learned to code Java in High School 
            and fell in love with programming right away.
            I've since learned python to better accomplish my goals and ideas for projects that interested me.
            Nothing excites me more than learning new things
            and expanding my knowledge and skills.

                <p>NEAT2048 is a machine learning project made to learn to play the game 2048.
                It uses NEAT-Python for the neural network. Sadly this project did not get very far
                and that AI was only able to become a bit better than random in my attempts.
                I realize now that NEAT was not the method that should have been used for a game like this.
                However I did learn a lot and it was fun to watch the AI attempt to learn the game.

                <p>In this project I created a SQL database for storing book information and files which can be edited
