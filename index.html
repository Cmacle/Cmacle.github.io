       <h1>Conor McAuliffe</h1>
       <p>Hi, I'm Conor. I've worked in the Audio-Visual field for a few years
           before moving on to chase my passion in programming. I have experience working or leading
           teams of people to accomplish large tasks and run events. I learned to code Java in High School 
           and fell in love with programming right away.
           I've since also learned python to better accomplish my goals and ideas for projects that interested me.
           Nothing excites me more than learning new things
           and expanding my knowledge and skills. 
       </p>
